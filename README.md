29 Dec - 4:30PM - Everything working correctly through step 9. (As always, I wish I understood this better.  The routing commands in Express are pretty opaque to me.)

30 Dec - 6:30PM - For whatever reason, the 'delete' functionality wasn't working...so I forked the author's repo to see if the problem was there also.  That one worked fine.  I reloaded my own version with the intent of comparing it to the author's- but when I started everything up, mine worked fine too.  Go figure.  Happy New Year to anyone reading this.
